# **SIKEAN Sales Performance Analysis 2022**

## **Project Backround**

SIKEAN, a USA e-commerce company founded in 2018, specializes in selling  office supplies, furniture and technology products. I'm partnering with the Head of Operations to perform analysis and extract insights for company's sales performance of 2022 and deliver recommendations to improve performance across sales, product and marketing teams.

## **Executive Summary**

SIKEAN's sales analysis of 113k records across 2021 and 2022 shows for 2022 that YTD (Year To Date) company's profit was around $ 1.34M that is 4.5% more than last year with YTD Margin to reach 11.6%, 5.4% more than 2021. However, the amount of sales is 7.3% less than 2021 with a YTD Quantity around 107K orders. We had less sales in the categories of Office Supplies and Technology and more sales in Furnitures than last year. Our Top selling category was Office Suplies with the top selling product to be staples.

 

## **Insights Deep Dive**

### **Sales Trends and Growth Rates**

- SIKEAN averages $11.5 million in YTD sales with 107,200 orders.

- Sales declined by 7.3% than previous year and that must be the outcome of the fact that COVID is close to its end and physical stores have start to reopen.

- SIKEAN's 2022 YTD profit is around $1.34 million with YTD margin to reach 11.58%.

- Both profit and margin is higher than 2021 with profit to be 4.5% more and margin surged 5.4% more. A further analysis is needed here in order to understand why we had less sales but more profit.
