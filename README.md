# **SIKEAN Sales Performance Analysis 2022**

## **Project Backround**

SIKEAN, a USA e-commerce company founded in 2018, specializes in selling  office supplies, furniture and technology products. I'm partnering with the Head of Operations to perform analysis and extract insights for company's sales performance of 2022 and deliver recommendations to improve performance across sales, product and marketing teams.

## **Executive Summary**

SIKEAN's sales analysis of 113k records across 2021 and 2022 shows for 2022 that YTD (Year To Date) company's profit was around $ 1.34M that is 4.5% more than last year with YTD Margin to reach 11.6%, 5.4% more than 2021. However, the amount of sales is 7.3% less than 2021 with a YTD Quantity around 107K orders. We had less sales in the categories of Office Supplies and Technology and more sales in Furnitures than last year. Our Top selling category was Office Suplies with the top selling product to be staples.

## **Insights Deep Dive**

### **Sales Trends and Growth Rates**

#### Overall

- SIKEAN averages $11.5 million in YTD sales with 107,200 orders.

- Sales declined by 7.3% than previous year and that must be the outcome of the fact that COVID is close to its end and physical stores have start to reopen.

- SIKEAN's 2022 YTD profit is around $1.34 million with YTD margin to reach 11.58%.

- Both profit and margin is higher than 2021 with profit to be 4.5% more and margin surged 5.4% more. A further analysis is needed here in order to understand why we had less sales but more profit. Was it because we increased our product prices or because we had more sales on expensive products?

- Home Office: Since people working remotely is becoming more and more common, especially now during COVID, the sales rise in furnitures and technology is something we were waiting for, since these people need the appropriate equipment including desks, chairs, laptops, headphones screens etc. This is something we can easily also see from the grpah with top 5 products by sales.

## **Recommendations**

### **Maximazing Product Offerings**

- **Expand high performing categories**: Increase catalog variation in stamples and KI adjustable height tables since these categories had the best performance regarding YTD sales. Especially KI adjustable height tables are a very promising investment now, during the pandemic.
Here are some of the reasons why:

  1. **Rise of Hybrid and Remote Work especially during COVID**: Many companies have adopted flexible work environments, requiring ergonomic furniture that supports both office and home setups. Also, employees want desks that adapt to their needs, whether working from home or in shared office spaces.
  2. **Increased Focus on Employee Health & Ergonomics**: Prolonged sitting has been linked to health issues like back pain, poor posture, and cardiovascular risks.
Adjustable height tables allow workers to alternate between sitting and standing, improving circulation and reducing discomfort.

So as an e-commerce company we can offer KI adjustable height tables with different kind of wood, quality and durability.

- **Bundle & Subscription Offers for low performance products**:
  1. Offer printer-paper bundles (e.g., "Buy a printer and get 2 reams of paper at 50% off")
  2. Suggest related products at checkout using a recommendation system (e.g., Cisco phone accessories, file boxes with label packs)
  3. Reevaluate pricing strategy
  4. Promotional gifts
